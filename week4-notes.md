# Week 4 Notes

## Cracker

The code is available on Github, as before,
[at this link](https://github.com/Oak-Grove-Classical-Academy/cracker). See Week 2's
 notes on how to clone it, but you can just browse it here if you wish.

## Password security

We talked about password hashes, how they are stored, salting, and making computations take longer on purpose. You can 
read more about best practices and details on the [OWASP site.](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html#introduction)
