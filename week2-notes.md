# Week 2 Notes

## Cracker

Good job on naming the project!

It's now available on Github, [at this link](https://github.com/Oak-Grove-Classical-Academy/cracker). If you just want to browse the code, you can do it right there.
If you want to download it, you need to clone it first:

This [VS Code documentation page](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/intro-to-git#_clone-a-repository-locally) shows you how to do it. From the Source Control sidebar, 
click "Clone Repository", then paste in the repository URL. It's the same one as above: https://github.com/Oak-Grove-Classical-Academy/cracker

It'll ask you where to clone it, so you'll probably want to create a new folder, name it something, then "Select as Repository Destintation", then Open it. It should 
look like any other folder you opened and you can play around.
