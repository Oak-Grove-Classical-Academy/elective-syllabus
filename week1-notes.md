# Week 1 Notes

## Xcode/Visual Studio

If for any reason your `rustup` install got canceled, or you tried to run `cargo install rustlings` and it gave you a lot of red, you need the developer tools for your platform.
For Windows, just re-run the `rustup.exe` installer and choose option 1 to install the prerequisites. For Mac, you can run this in a terminal: `xcode-select --install`, then look for
the window that popped up to install the tools. 

## Terminal

You don't need to use the system terminal, especially on Windows. Use the one that comes with VSCode. You'll find a menu item in the top bar that says "Terminal" (if your screen is narrow, that 
may be hidden behind a `...`).

## Rustlings

Once you have rustlings installed, you can open that terminal, `cd rustlings`, then `rustlings` to start it. Then you can open the rustlings folder in VSCode and have both the code and the rustlings 
"Watch Mode" open. Refer to the instructions on the rustlings site to get going. In every exercise folder's README.md, you'll also find a link to the Rust book chapter. Read that! It'll teach you what you need to know for that exercise and it is very, very good.

## Homework

Per the syllabus, work through Rustlings Exercise 3. You have 3 weeks before we meet again, that should be plenty of time. To get the most out of this class, work ahead or start playing around with your own project.

## Asking for help

Before you ask me for help, look back at the resources linked from the syllabus and follow those. If you get really stuck, please do email me. But I expect you to put in some work and try it yourself first.

## The Syllabus

Did I mention the syllabus is your prime resource? Make sure you read it.
