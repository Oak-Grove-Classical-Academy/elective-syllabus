# 2024/2025 Cybersecurity & Rust Programming Elective

## Course Description

The purpose of this course is to expose you to programming and cybersecurity
concepts, and what it may be like to work in a field like this. That means you
need no prior knowledge of either, only a general interest. See below for the
topics we will cover.

## Goals

1. I want to expose you to programming, cybersecurity, and general engineering
   work so that you can decide whether you'd like to work in this area. If you
   decide you do and show aptitude in the subject matter, I'll gladly help you
   along with letters of recommendation and general guidance. If you don't think
   this is for you, that's perfectly fine! Assuming I did an okay job teaching,
   figuring this out for yourself is a valuable outcome. I still expect you to
   participate in the class to the best of your ability.

2. I want to be a resource for you as an engineer. Please feel free to ask
   questions related to any of these topics.

## Expectations

I have the highest expectations as regards your behavior and conduct because I
know you are capable of rising to them. Specifically, this means:

1. Act in accordance with the OGCA Code of Conduct
1. Be engaged. The more you put into this class, the more you will get out.
1. Pay attention. No side conversations or distracting behavior.

## Grades

This is a Pass/Fail course. You will be graded on attendance and participation.
If you show up and participate, you'll do great!

## Topics

### Rust programming

We'll focus on working through Rustlings, a guided tour through Rust. The
Rustlings exercises refer to chapters in the Official Rust Book, which you
should bookmark and read. See below for [what you'll need](#what-youll-need).

### Project

We'll also work on a small project together. I will live-code it, you are free
to follow along. Code will be on Github later. For this semester it'll be a
small password utility that can generate random passwords and phrases, and maybe
crack hashes (if we get to it). I hope to show you the every-day kind of work
you may be doing as a (software) engineer.

### CTF

Capture the Flag exercises are pretty popular in the cybersecurity space, so
you, the class, will compete against me to try and capture hidden flags. If
anyone finds the flag and emails it to me by Thursday night before class, I'll
bring a treat to class. These will increase in difficulty every week. You'll get
a new hint every week in class.

Flags will be of the format `og{This is the flag}`. You'd email me "This is the
flag", which is the flag. Pretty straightforward.

The CTF hint is: `ctf.alltohim.io`

## Non-Topics

While closely related to software engineering, we won't have time to dive into
any of these. But let me know if you're interested and we can touch on them or
take it offline.

### Version Control

You won't need to know anything about `git` or Github for this class, but it'd
be helpful if you wanted to continue in this area.

## What you'll need

To get set up for the class, do these in order.

1. Have a Mac, Linux, or Windows laptop (and bring it to class each week)
1. Bookmark and read this syllabus:
   https://github.com/Oak-Grove-Classical-Academy/elective-syllabus
1. Download and set up [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
   - [VSCode tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/getting-started)
   - [Intro Videos](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/introvideos)
     about how to use VSCode
1. Install
   [all the Rust stuff](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/rust)
1. Install [Rustlings](https://rustlings.cool/)
1. Read [The Official Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html)

## Additional Resources

- [cheats.rs](https://cheats.rs/): It has all the things. May be a bit
  overwhelming, but if you know what you're looking for, it's a great resource.

## Homework

I expect you to finish the Rustlings exercises we started in class and read the
associated chapters in the Rust book. Then come with questions. If you don't, I
will assume you understand it perfectly and may test you.
