## Notes from Student Feedback

- Go slower and explain concepts in more depth, especially for beginners.
- Dedicate time to basics and setup, including a "crash course" day.
- Encourage questions and provide extra support for those who miss early classes.
- Integrate more Rust syntax and language fundamentals alongside projects.
- Use practical exercises and real-world examples.
- Provide resources for catching up if absent.
