# 2024/2025 Cybersecurity & Rust Programming Elective

## Course Description

The purpose of this course is to expose you to programming and cybersecurity concepts, and what it may be like to work in a field like this. That means you need no prior knowledge of either, only a general interest. In this course you will learn some basics of programming in the Rust language, as well as some cybersecurity topics.

## Topics

### Rust programming

We'll focus on working through [Rustlings exercises](https://rustlings.cool), so be sure and get set up for that. The exercises refer to chapters in the [Official Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html), which you should bookmark.

### Project

We'll also work on a small project together. I will live-code it, and you are free to follow along. Code will be on Github later. For this semester it'll be a small password utility that can
generate random passwords and phrases, and maybe crack hashes (if we get to it).

### CTF

Capture the Flag exercises are pretty popular in the cybersecurity space, so you, the class, will compete against me to try and capture hidden flags. If anyone finds the flag and emails it to me
by Thursday night before class, I'll bring donuts to class. These will increase in difficulty every week. You'll get the a hint every week in class.

## What you'll need

- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [All the Rust stuff](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/rust)
- [Rustlings](https://rustlings.cool/)

## Homework

I expect you to finish the Rustlings exercises we started in class and read the associated chapters in the Rust book. Then come with questions. If you don't, I will assume you understand it perfectly and 
may test you.
